### What's up!

My name is Juan Carlos Blanco Delgado, welcome to my GitHub ðŸ˜„

- ðŸŒ±  I am currently learning about cloud-computing, and learning more about Docker & Kubernetes to be able to deploy the projects using its technology! Please drop me any good material :) 

- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite music genre is mushy songs and I love to sing, but you will probably not like it very much!
